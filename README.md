        <p class="p">Now I'm not trying to be pessimistic or anything, but my day was horrible. But you might understand my meaning is you hear what happened to me.<br>I was programming a video game with stealing and monsters and all that creepy stuff, when all of a sudden a stone whizzed by my head and shattered my screen. The monsters from my game started climbing out of my screen and when I turned around to run I saw the outlaw on large from my game standing in my doorway.

   <p class="p"> Quit worrying I'm awake now, and I would have passed all that off as a horrible night-mare if my computer screen hadn't been smashed and my jornal had an accurate recollection of my dream. My neighbour Galein is a troublemaker so I'll head over there to see what he knows of it.

   <p class="p"> Galien wasn't home, and the street was deserted. It's the Ides March, now I've never been superstitious before, but this one creepy day. I'm going to visit the detective's office.</p>
